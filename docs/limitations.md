# Limitations

Read the forecasts with these limits in mind.

## Evidence

- The historical evaluation is retrospective. It assumes that a result and its xG are available on the day after the match. Historical odds have no quote times.
- Each season panel has only nine to eleven seasons. Its intervals are wide. See [validation](validation.md).
- The prospective ledger started in September 2026. It has few settled matches.
- The only comparison is with M2 and with the betting market. There is no comparison with public forecast models yet.

## Inputs

- Only the Premier League has xG. The other three divisions use goals only.
- M7 does not use lineups, injuries, suspensions or transfers.
- The collector runs every twelve hours. It can miss late team news.
- The model does not forecast future sanctions or appeals. A forecast applies only the sanctions known at its cutoff.

## Model

- The filter is an approximation. It uses a Laplace step each day and a finite set of three noise values.
- Dynamics parameters are fixed. They are not estimated from the data.
- Entry priors come from few clubs at some boundaries, for example clubs promoted from a curtailed season. Their intervals can be too wide or too narrow.
- The market-assisted weight is 1.0. Thus the market-assisted probability adds no model information to the market price.

## Season rules

- A tied playoff tie resolves with equal chances for each club. The rules data has no model of extra time or penalties.
- A playoff final uses an equal mixture of the two home designations.
- Playoff dates are synthetic offsets from the last regular-season match.
- A postponed or undated fixture is simulated on the cutoff day until the provider gives a new date. The public forecast lists each such fixture.
- A match in progress, or a result that is overdue, stops the season projection.
- Premier League European places need an explicit cup scenario. The published forecast shows only top-four and top-five positions.

## Operation

- Forecasts run on one local machine because they need the private data archive.
- The scheduler is a macOS launch agent.
- A checkout of this repository contains no provider data.
