# Data and provenance

The product uses provider data that stays on the local machine. Git does not contain provider data. Provider terms control its use and redistribution.

## Providers

| Provider | What the product uses | Divisions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API-Football | Fixtures, schedules, status, teams and league standings | All four |
| Football-Data | Results and average pre-closing and closing odds | All four |
| Understat | Team xG for each match | Premier League only |
| FPL | Nothing in M7; captured for research | Premier League |

The collector also captures squads, players, lineups, transfers, injuries and match statistics. M7 does not use these inputs. The collector keeps them because a pre-match observation cannot be recovered later. They support research on the [research branch](research.md).

## Credentials and quota

Set `API_FOOTBALL_KEY` in the environment or in an ignored `.env` file. Do not put a key in a committed file. The Pro plan gives 7,500 requests each day. A backfill keeps 1,000 requests free for current collection.

## Storage

All provider data is under `data/`, which Git ignores.

| Path | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `data/raw/<provider>/<hash>` | Raw responses. They are immutable and identified by content hash. |
| `data/requests/` | One record for each successful request: URL, retrieval time, hash and context. |
| `data/parquet/<table>/` | Canonical tables, partitioned by competition and season. |
| `data/manifests/` | Publication manifests. A Parquet file is visible only after its manifest exists. |
| `data/audits/` | Collection status and coverage audits. |

DuckDB queries the Parquet files in process. There is no database server. One writer lock stops two processes from writing at the same time.

## Canonical tables

`src/epl_forecast/datasets.py` defines the schema. The main tables are `competition_seasons`, `teams`, `fixtures`, `odds` and `team_process` (xG). The player tables are `players`, `memberships`, `appearances`, `availability`, `transfers` and `player_process`.

Each row keeps its provider, its actual retrieval time, its evidence basis and the hash of its raw response. `Dataset(root, cutoff)` shows only the evidence retrieved by the cutoff. `Dataset.fixtures()` joins the providers and refuses contradictory identities, dates and scores.

## Identity and reviewed corrections

These files hold reviewed decisions. Change them only with evidence.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/epl_forecast/data/teams.csv` | Canonical team IDs and provider names. Extend it; do not invent a slug. |
| `src/epl_forecast/data/api_player_aliases.csv` | Provider player-ID aliases, with same-fixture evidence. |
| `src/epl_forecast/data/api_fixture_disputes.json` | Provider records that contradict other evidence. |
| `src/epl_forecast/data/understat_date_corrections.json` | Understat dates that disagree with the fixture list. |
| `src/epl_forecast/data/pl_adjustments.json` | Reviewed Premier League sanctions and their announcement dates. |
| `src/epl_forecast/data/efl_adjustments.json` | Reviewed EFL sanctions. |
| `src/epl_forecast/data/efl_rules_evidence.json` | Reviewed EFL rules for promotion, playoffs and ties. |

When a source is internally inconsistent, the field becomes unknown and the audit reports it. The code does not normalize the conflict away.

A regular-season match ID is `competition:season:home:away`. A postponement does not change it. Playoff matches have separate IDs. They never enter the regular-season table or model training.

## Commands

```sh
uv run epl-forecast data collect      # capture due observations for all four divisions
uv run epl-forecast data audit        # check hashes and fixtures; write data/audits/coverage.json
uv run epl-forecast data backfill --start 2010 --max-requests 200
uv run epl-forecast data normalize    # rebuild the canonical store from raw captures
uv run epl-forecast data query --sql 'SELECT competition_id, count(*) FROM fixtures GROUP BY 1'
```

`data normalize` replays every raw capture into a new store. It replaces the old store only after the new one passes its checks. Stop scheduled runs first.

A backfill of history is retrospective evidence. It does not show what was known before a historical match. Only prospective captures show that.

## Back up

Back up `data/`, `runs/` and `snapshots/`. Git cannot restore them.
