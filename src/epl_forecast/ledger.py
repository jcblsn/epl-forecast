"""Prospective scoring over the published forecast archive.

The ledger reads only published documents and realized results, so it can be
rebuilt at any time without touching the forecasts themselves. A match is scored
once, against the last snapshot generated before its kickoff, and season
snapshots are listed as pending until their season settles.
