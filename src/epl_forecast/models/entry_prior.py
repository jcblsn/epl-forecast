"""Transition-aware entry priors for a club arriving from another division.

A continuing club keeps the target-division state the filter already holds for
it. A club entering the division is described instead by a prior learned from
earlier entrants of the same transition, optionally conditioned on the strength
it showed in its source division and on a time-weighted memory of its own older
target-division form. Nothing here reads a provider: every feature is a summary
of league seasons the archive already holds.
