"""Sanctioned league tables derived from retained provider standings.

Archived results give the points a team earned on the pitch. They do not record
disciplinary or financial sanctions, so a table computed from results alone is not
the table the competition actually finished on. The retained API-Football standings
are the provider's own table, sanctions included; the difference between a team's
standings points and the points its archived results imply is that team's net
adjustment.

A difference is only evidence of a sanction when the two tables describe the same
matches, so every team is checked against the prefix of its own fixtures that the
provider says it had played, and the provider's goal difference must agree with the
archive over that prefix. Teams that fail the check are reported as unknown rather
than silently credited with an adjustment; a season whose snapshot is a partial
mid-season table fails for nearly every team and yields no sanctioned table at all.

Two views come out of the same derivation. ``final_adjustments`` is truth: what the
completed table says, used to score a finished season. ``known_adjustments`` is what
a forecaster could have applied at a cutoff, which needs a date the sanction was
knowable. Reviewed registries carry real announcement dates; a derived adjustment
carries only the date its standings snapshot was retrieved, so a sanction seen for
the first time in a retrospective capture is knowable to no in-season forecast.
