# English league forecasts

Probabilistic forecasts for the four divisions of English league football: the Premier League, the Championship, League One and League Two. The product forecasts every remaining match and the final table of each division. It updates every twelve hours.

## What it forecasts

For each remaining match:

- home, draw and away probabilities;
- an exact-score distribution;
- a market-assisted probability when a betting-market quote exists.

For each club:

- the full distribution of final points and final position;
- expected points and rank, with 50%, 80% and 90% intervals;
- title, top-four, top-five and relegation probabilities (Premier League);
- title, automatic promotion, playoff, promotion and relegation probabilities (Championship, League One and League Two), with the playoff bracket simulated.

The forecasts also show how much each fixture in the next seven days can move each club's season.

## Model

One model, M7, makes every published forecast. M7 gives each club a latent strength and a latent openness. These change over time. Goals and, in the Premier League, expected goals (xG) update them each day. Clubs that change division start from priors learned from earlier clubs that made the same move. Each simulated season draws the uncertain team strengths and lets them change until the last match. A simpler Poisson model, M2, is the benchmark.

See the [methodology](docs/methodology.md) and the [season simulation rules](docs/simulation.md).

## Public forecasts

Each published snapshot is in `site/data/forecasts/<snapshot>/<division>.json`. `site/data/index.json` lists all snapshots and `site/data/ledger.json` scores the settled matches. A snapshot is never changed after it is published.

To view the forecasts on your computer:

```sh
uv run python -m http.server -d site 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>. The GitHub Pages workflow publishes the same `site/` directory. It runs only when started by hand.

## Run it

You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), an API-Football key and a local data archive. Provider data is not in this repository.

```sh
uv sync --locked
export API_FOOTBALL_KEY=...                # or put it in an ignored .env file
uv run epl-forecast data backfill --start 2010 --max-requests 200   # first time only
uv run epl-forecast operate
```

`operate` collects new data, forecasts all four divisions, verifies each forecast and publishes the verified snapshot to `site/`. See [operations](docs/operations.md).

## Validation

- Every forecast archive passes the checks in the [product contract](docs/mvp.md) before publication. For example, event probabilities must sum to the places that the rules award.
- Historical season panels compare M7 with M2 in every division: rank, points and event scores at five points in each season.
- A match scoreboard compares M7 with M2 and with the betting market.
- The prospective ledger scores each published forecast after the match.

The [validation summary](docs/validation.md) gives the results and the commands to reproduce them.

## Limitations

- Only the Premier League has xG. The other divisions use goals only.
- The model does not use lineups, injuries or transfers.
- The historical evaluation is retrospective, and it covers only nine to eleven seasons in each division.
- Some playoff and scheduling details are explicit approximations.

See all [limitations](docs/limitations.md).

## Development

```sh
scripts/verify.sh
```

This formats, lints and tests the code. GitHub Actions runs the same checks and the publication boundary check on every push and pull request.

Provider data is used under each provider's terms. It is not redistributed.
